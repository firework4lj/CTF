	/* How this class works:
	 * 
	 * This class listens for entities damaging another entity.
	 * If the player is attacked by another player, the player is checked to first, be in the game. 
	 * If so, they are then checked to be on the other team. If both conditions are met, the victim then takes damage.
	 * If the players are on the same team, the damage is cancelled and the attacker is sent a message to stop attacking there own team.
	 * If the players are not in the game, the event is allowed and players can be damaged like normal.
